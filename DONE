  - Slow-down system rewritten; moved from Display to Terminal. Works
    more reliably; 'only' ~10 - 15% slower than the comparable abstract
    terminal. Speed is calculated assuming 8-N-1 transfer, in effect
    leading to 9 bits per char. Would be fun to compare the speed to
    a real VT-terminal...

  - Drawing of the lines that have blinking characters rewritten. Now
    blinking works well also when drawing (like in VT-animations); not just
    when the screen is static like before
29-Mar-99, TSa:
  - Fixed two small bugs:
    o Wasn't sending telnet-initialization stuff (NAWS not working);
      code was commented out... :-)
    o Filtered bare LFs out (assuming telnet always sends NVT-linefeeds,
      ie. \r\n), and Pine at least had problems with that.
    Thanks to Mats Anderson (author of MindTerm) for pointing out the
    problems with Pine.
15-Apr-99, TSa:
  - Due to platform-specific incompabilities (Win95 JDK vs. Linux JDK),
    added new class, PlatformSpecific. It is used by other classes to
    get certain platform-dependant values and object instances, when
    they differ on various platforms. For example:

    o Graphics.setXORMode(c); c needs to be different on Win95 JDK
      than on Linux JDK, at least when drawing the cursor.
    o Font widths are reported incorrectly on Win95 JDK it seems;
      the reported width needs to be halved (actually, w = (w / 2) -1)
      before it can be used for calculation!
    o Number of Image-instances AWT is allowed to create appears to be
      rather low on Win95; thus, different strategy needs to be used
      when creating doubled characters and special symbols. On
      X-windows systems, the size of distinct character image is being
      kept small, which means that the number of Images is larger.
      On MS-Windows this is not possible ("OutOfMemory" reports JDK...),
      and thus we need to cram more chars per image.
