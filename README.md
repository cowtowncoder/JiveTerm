# JiveTerm

## What is it?

JiveTerm is a so-called "terminal emulator". If this term is unfamiliar to you, fret not -- think of it as something from era of slide rule, C-cassette and dinosaurs. That is, something that was used in the past, and is of interest to fossils like its author

## No, really?

Ok. Terminal emulators, like xterm, are things younger people call "shell windows" or "consoles"; or at least visual part of it. So JiveTerm is something like "xterm written in Java".

## History

This is actually the very second or third Java thing I wrote, back in mid-to-late 90s. It was lots of fun and work to write; and back in the day was amazingly fast compared to other attempts at Java terminal emulators -- it actually run fine and smooth on a 60 Mhz pentium Linux box.
